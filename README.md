# Entropy and Complexity of art

This notebook calculates Shanon Entropy and complexity analysis of Best Artworks of All Time dataset( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time).

## Entropy and Complexity
 two parameters which are evaluated for each painting.  Shannon Entropy:

Normalised Shannon entropy :

The second parameter, complexity:

# Data
The collection of paintings used in this project is from Best Artworks of All Time dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time

In this figure, each dot represents a piece of artwork on the complexity-entropy axes. The colors of the dots coordinate with the time period in which they were made. Here we find a trend that holds true to the thermodynamic patterning: As entropy approaches maximum disorder, the complexity of the artwork diminishes. The slope concaves downward; the slope continues to decrease meaning for every unit of entropy increasing, the complexity plumets more. Interestingly, we also see some grouping in time periods of when artwork is produced. Modern and post-modern art of 1800 and beyond tends to be concentrated in higher entropy and lower complexity, while the renaissance and classic art of pre-1800 tend to be closer to the middle. With these trends, we can see that the patten of artwork on the complexity-entropy axes is clear.
